# Inteligent-Data-Generator
## Usage:
```
python main.py
```
there is only a need for an "input.json" file with a structure as provided

Additionally, you can now use the `converter.py` script to convert a `.sql` file containing database schema with `CREATE` statements into a compatible `input.json` file.

## Supported generation types as of now:
- firstName
- lastName
- gender
- ssn
- date
- city
- country
- province
- postalCode
- amount
- by data type (integer, string, date, decimal, float, text)
## Functionalities yet to be added:
